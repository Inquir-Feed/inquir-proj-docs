# **Feedback Provider Marketplace - Project Documentation**

## **Overview**

This project aims to create a platform similar to Upwork, where companies can post requests for feedback on their products (websites, games, software, etc.), and freelancers can submit proposals to provide that feedback. The goal is to streamline the feedback process, enabling companies to improve their product quality before going live. The platform will utilize a coin-based system, freelancer leveling, and various tools to enhance interaction, ensure quality feedback, and automate analysis for the company.

---

## **Business Model**

1. **Freelancer Coin System**
   - Freelancers will start with 10 coins, each coin enabling them to submit one proposal.
   - **Proposal Submission**: Each proposal costs 1 coin. If a freelancer's coins run out, they can purchase additional coins (1 coin = $1).
   - **Earning Coins**: Freelancers earn 1 coin for each completed feedback and gain 1 level for every feedback delivered.
2. **Service Charges for Companies**
   - Companies will specify a price for the feedback task. Upon task completion, 95% of the amount will go to the freelancers, and 5% will be taken as a service charge by the platform.
3. **Freelancer Levels**
   - Freelancers increase their level with each completed feedback task.
   - Companies can specify the minimum level of freelancers eligible to apply for a feedback request, ensuring high-quality feedback from experienced users.
